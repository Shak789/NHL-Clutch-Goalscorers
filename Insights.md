Below are key insights from the model that can lead to actionable decisions from management and coaches (as of **December 31st 2025**):

### Players who Elevate their Game in Close/Tied Games
Dylan Guenther's clutch score ranks top 5 and is approximately 20% higher than his predicted clutch score. This indicates he elevates his play significantly in critical situations and should continue to be deployed in close/tied games and overtime. Opponents should prioritize defensive coverage on him when the score is tight.

### Players who Prioritize Playmaking
Connor McDavid is regarded as one of the best hockey players in the world, but does not rank in the top 100 in clutch goalscoring. His actual score is over 10% lower than his predicted score. However, more than 45% of his predicted score is from assists. Due to his elite assist metrics, the model would expect McDavid to be a clutch goalscorer, but he is most likely creating plays rather than scoring goals in high-pressure situations. He is scoring at a lower rate compared to his 64 goal season in 2022-2023 and his clutch score has also decreased since then. McDavid should be deployed with Draisaitl in close and tied games, since Draisaitl ranks first in clutch scoring. Opponents should focus on covering the passing lane when McDavid has the puck in tight games.

### Determining if Clutch Score is Just Luck
Morgan Geekie ranks 5th in clutch score and is nearly 10% above his predicted score. However, over 60% of his predicted clutch score is impacted by shooting percentage which means he may be scoring at an unsustainable rate. There may be potential regression, but teams should prioritize shot blocking. Geekie has limited playmaking ability, since close to 0% of his predicted score is affected by assists. 

### Players Expected to Regress Positively
Although Brayden Point ranks low in clutch scoring, the model predicts him to have a 15% higher clutch score, which would rank him in the top 20. This demonstrates that Point still has strong underlying metrics and is due for a bounce-back.
