Currently using a rigorous statistical approach to update the classification model.

I have compared various classfication models (Random Forest, Xgboost, KNN) with Friedman's test and post hoc analysis. Now I am working on eliminating overfitting by looking at hyperparameter tuning and the learning curves. 

More details to follow.
